# Digital Compact Cassette Sound Engineer for Windows
_Recording studios have recording engineers. DCC-Studio needs DCC Sound Engineer._

The DCC-175 was a portable Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) recorder that could be connected to a PC using the PC-Link cable. The PC-link cable included the "DCC-Studio" software to control the recorder, copy audio to hard disk and back to tape, and do some simple music editing.

Unfortunately, the DCC-Studio software has some flaws that we want to fix with DCC Sound Engineer (DCCSE).

DCCSE will eventually become a 32-bit interactive graphical Windows application that will run on Windows 98 and later, such as:

* Convert DCC Studio files to MP1 without loss (because they essentially are already MP1 files)
* Convert MP1 files to DCC-Studio files
* Convert WAV files and maybe other formats to DCC-Studio files
* Convert DCC-Studio files to WAV or other formats
* Playback DCC-Studio files on computer speakers
* Edit track and artist information in TRK files
* Generate tape compilations (CMP files)

We don't have enough information yet to control the DCC-175 through the parallel cable (if you have any information or would like to help reverse-engineering the existing software, please let us know!).

We are aware that there are many DCC-175 recorder owners who don't have a DCC-Link cable (Philips made way fewer cables than recorders). But we may eventually gather enough information to make our own cable. Our cable may not work with DCC-Studio (it's likely to use USB, not the parallel port) but we'll make sure that DCCSE will be able to use our cable to do at least some of the things DCC-Studio can do: control the recorder, copy audio to and from hard disk to tape, create compilations etc.

At this time, this software is highly experimental and not ready for use yet. Please be patient. Follow the DCC Museum on Facebook to stay informed.
